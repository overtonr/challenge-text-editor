# Unit 19 PWA Challenge: Text Editor

## Your Task

As you have progressed through this course, you have put together a number of impressive projects that you can show off to potential employers. This project is no exception; in fact, it features some of the most impressive expressions of the concepts you have learned so far.

Your task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

To build this text editor, you will start with an existing application and implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. You will use a package called `idb`, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data, and is used by companies like Google and Mozilla.

You will deploy this full-stack application to Heroku using the [Heroku Deployment Guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/heroku/heroku-deployment-guide).

## User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
```

## Acceptance Criteria


WHEN I open the text editor
THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
WHEN I click on the Install button
THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
WHEN I load my web application
THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox
WHEN I register a service worker
THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
WHEN I deploy to Heroku
THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
```

## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

## Grading Requirements

This challenge is graded based on the following criteria:

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%

* Satisfies all of the above acceptance criteria plus the following:

  * Uses IndexedDB to create an object store and includes both GET and PUT methods

  * The application works without an internet connection

  * Automatically saves content inside the text editor when the DOM window is unfocused

  * Bundled with webpack

  * Create a service worker with workbox that Caches static assets

  * The application should use babel in order to use async / await

  * Application must have a generated `manifest.json` using the `WebpackPwaManifest` plug-in

  * Can be installed as a Progressive Web Application
  npm install
  npm start:dev
